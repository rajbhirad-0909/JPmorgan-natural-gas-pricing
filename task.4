📌 Task 4 – FICO Score Bucketing (Quantization)
JPMorgan Chase & Co. – Quantitative Research Virtual Experience

This task focuses on categorizing (quantizing) FICO scores into buckets so that a credit risk model (which accepts categorical inputs) can estimate the probability of default (PD) more efficiently.

We evaluate four different bucketing techniques and compare their performance using probability of default separation and log-likelihood.📂 Dataset

Each record contains:

fico_score

default (1 = default, 0 = non-default)

Dataset path:

Task 3 and 4_Loan_Data.csv🧠 Methods Implemented
1️⃣ Equal-Width Buckets

Splits FICO values into equal numeric ranges.

2️⃣ Equal-Frequency Buckets

Each bucket has (approximately) the same number of borrowers.

3️⃣ K-Means Clustering Buckets

Buckets are formed using unsupervised clustering.

4️⃣ Dynamic Programming Optimal Buckets (Best method)

Maximizes the log-likelihood, giving the most statistically sound bucketing.📊 Results Summary
Method	Log-Likelihood	Notes
DP Optimal	⭐ Highest	Best PD separation
K-Means	Good	Better than simple methods
Equal-Frequency	Medium	Balanced buckets
Equal-Width	Lowest	Simplest but weakest
✔DP Optimal Bucket Edges
[520, 580, 640, 696]
📈 Visualizations

Four PNG charts are generated:

figures/equal_width.png
figures/equal_freq.png
figures/kmeans.png
figures/dp_optimal.png


Each chart shows PD (%) trends across the buckets.
🧩 Final Conclusion

The Dynamic Programming (DP) bucketing method offers the best quantization of FICO scores, making it the preferred choice for credit risk modeling.
